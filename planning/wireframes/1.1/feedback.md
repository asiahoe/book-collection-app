* Adding a second search bar to search the library adds redundancy that confuses the user, and ventures away from the minimum viable product.
* Enabling multiple views on search results and libraries pages adds a layer of redundancy since the user can click through to view the details of individual books. It also ventures away from the minimum viable product.
